# youtube-chat-companion

YouTube Chat Companion is an interactive tool that allows users to engage in real-time conversations based on YouTube video transcripts. By analyzing the spoken content of videos, the project enables users to ask questions, clarify topics, and discuss key points, enhancing their understanding and experience of the videos. Whether for learning, entertainment, or exploration, this companion transforms passive viewing into an active dialogue.

This project was implemented for 
[LLM Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp) -
